The [rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io) project was today highlighted at the Neural Information Processing Systems [(NIPS)](http://nips.cc/) conference, one of the main forums for machine learning and scientific computation. We gave a presentation at the [Machine Learning Open Source Software (MLOSS) workshop](http://nips.cc/Conferences/2013/Program/event.php?ID=3710).

A number of other interesting projects were present, including [iPython](http://ipython.org/), [Factorie](http://factorie.cs.umass.edu/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and many others. For a full list, see the [MLOSS](http://mloss.org/workshop/nips13/) site.

While the rOpenGov ecosystem is based on R, we actively seek connections with related initiatives in other languages, such as Python or Julia. The [iPython](http://ipython.org/) is particularly interesting in this regard with its fluent tools to mix code from various languages with automated document generation tools that support LaTeX and markdown. An added R support for this project would extend the applicability of rOpenGov toolkits beyond the R community. Looking forward!

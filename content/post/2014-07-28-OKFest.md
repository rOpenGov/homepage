Open Knowledge Festival - Berlin, July 15-17, 2014
=====================

[rOpenGov](http://ropengov.github.io) developers met at the [Open
Knowledge Festival](http://2014.okfestival.org/programme/) in Berlin,
July 15-17. We discussed the development of representation formats for
social/political science data sets. The
[psData](https://github.com/rOpenGov/psData/tree/devPanel) package for
panel series data is now under active development, and further plans
include similar structures for election and other data
sources. Standardized representation formats will allow the
development and application of analysis algorithms beyond particular
applications. Robert Gentleman from Bioconductor has
[said](http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n10/full/nbt.2721.html):
'If everybody puts their - - data into the same kind of box, it
doesn't matter how the data came about, but that box is the same and
can be used by analytic tools. Really, I think it's data structures
that drive interoperability.'

Overall, the OKFest 2014 was a great success with an interesting
program and good athmosphere. Thanks for all organizers and
participants!

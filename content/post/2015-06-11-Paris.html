<p>Digital humanities is one of the fields where reproducible research is
now becoming increasingly popular. We got an opportunity to highlight the
latest advancement in this field in Paris <a href="http://dhdhi.hypotheses.org/2428">Digital Humanities
event</a>, June 12 at <a href="http://www.dhi-paris.fr/">Deutsches
Historische Institut Paris</a>.</p>
<p>The ‘digital humanities lab’ is an interactive experiment where the
audience actively participates in designing the analysis of massive
library catalogues. In particular, we focused on publishing activity
in the early modern period by mining the <a href="http://estc.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-estc">British Library ESTC
catalogue
1470-1800</a>. To
facilitate this interactive session, we prepared reproducible
presentation slides with
<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">Rmarkdown</a>. To be completed in the
workshop, carrying out data analysis on-the-fly together with the
audience. To reproduce the preliminary slides (we will complete them during the
workshop!), clone the <a href="https://github.com/rOpenGov/slides">rOpenGov slide
repository</a> and run the following
commands in R:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rmarkdown)
render(&quot;slides/20150612-Paris/20150611-Paris.Rmd&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately the ESTC data itself is not public, so we could not
share it. The slides and source code are fully reproducible, however,
so you can modify the template for your own purposes and check out our
summaries of the ESTC data collection at our <a href="https://github.com/rOpenGov/estc">estc
site</a>. You may also like to read the

<p>We used a combination of <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a> and the
<a href="http://github.com/rOpenGov/estc">estc</a> and
<a href="http://github.com/rOpenGov/bibliographica">bibliographica</a> R packages
that are designed for bibliographic data analysis. Combined with the
vast analytical capabilities of the R statistical ecosystem, these
custom tools for digital humanities provide a rapid development
toolkit for reproducible research of historical document collections.</p>

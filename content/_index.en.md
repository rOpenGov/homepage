**rOpenGov** is a community of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) package developers on open government data analytics and related topics.

The open collaboration network was initiated in 2010 and has since then led to many R packages and other fruitful outcomes. A number of independent authors have [contributed through github](https://github.com/ropengov/) and written to the [rOpenGov blog](/post/).

You are welcome to check out our [projects](/projects/) and join us. Proposals for new collaborations are also always welcome! See the [community page](/community/) for info on the people behind rOpenGov and get in touch.

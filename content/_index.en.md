[rOpenGov](http://ropengov.org) is a community of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) package developers on open government data analytics and related topics.

A number of independent authors have [contributed through github](https://github.com/ropengov/). We maintain the rOpenGov blog, which is also listed in [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/).

This open collaboration network was initiated around 2010, leading to many R packages and unexpected outcomes. You are welcome to check out our [projects](/projects/) and join us. The main focus is on data analytics and peer support. See [community page](/community/) for info on the people behind rOpenGov.

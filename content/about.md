About rOpenGov
==============

[rOpenGov](http://ropengov.org) is a community of [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) package developers on open government data analytics and related topics.

A number of independent authors have [contributed through github](http://ropengov.github.io), and we maintain the <a href="http://ropengov.org">rOpenGov blog</a>, also listed in [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/).

This open collaboration network was initiated around 2010, leading to many R packages and unexpected outcomes. Welcome to <a href="{{

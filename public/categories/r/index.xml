      <description>Scientific journal subscription costs in Finland: a preliminary analysis Detailed information on journal subscription costs paid to individual publishers by the Finnish research institutions has been released by the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture, and its Open Science and Research Initiative funded 2014–2017 (Academic Publishing Costs in Finland 2010–2015).
With this, Finland becomes to our knowledge the first country where annual subscription fees for all individual publishers and all major research institutions have been made available, spanning the years 2010-2015.</description>

      <description>R made personal (at least for swedes)! Background – Who are you? asked Mr Doe.
– I’m a Hindu! Namrata from India replied.
– I’m a statistician! said Günther from Germany.
People of different nationalities tend to identify themselves using different characteristics. In India, your identity might rely on your religion, while in other countries your profession might take its place. In Sweden, you might identify yourself with your almost-world-known (!</description>

      <description>Digital humanities is one of the fields where reproducible research is now becoming increasingly popular. We got an opportunity to highlight the latest advancement in this field in Paris Digital Humanities event, June 12 at Deutsches Historische Institut Paris.
The ‘digital humanities lab’ is an interactive experiment where the audience actively participates in designing the analysis of massive library catalogues. In particular, we focused on publishing activity in the early modern period by mining the British Library ESTC catalogue 1470-1800.</description>

      <description>rOpenGov is all about reproducible research, so preparing a reproducible poster became our mission after having the chance to present at International Conference on Computational Social Science (ICCSS 2015) in Helsinki, June 8-11, 2015 (poster 36 in Monday session 15:30-17:00).
We blended R code and output with the standard poster contents. The poster sources download data with our eurostat R package and automatically generates the final figures and the overall layout.</description>
